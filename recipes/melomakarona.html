        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Melomakarona are traditional Greek cookies enjoyed especially 
            during the Christmas season. These aromatic, honey-soaked 
            delights are made with olive oil, orange juice, and warm 
            spices like cinnamon and clove. Once baked, theyâ€™re dipped 
            in a fragrant syrup of honey and sugar, then sprinkled with 
            crushed walnuts for a rich and satisfying finish. Soft, moist,
            and naturally dairy-free, melomakarona capture the comforting
            lavors of the Mediterranean and the spirit of Greek 
            hospitality in every bite.</p>

                <li>200 g  sugar</li>
                <li>1 kilo of all purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp cooking soda</li>
                <li>1 tsp of ground clove</li>

            </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <h5>For the syrup</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>We heat a saucepan over medium to high heat, add the water,
                sugar, cinnamon sticks, lemon peels and orange peels, and 
                as soon as it comes to a boil</li>
                <li>Once the sugar dissolves, we remove the saucepan from the 
                heat and add the honey, stir, and set the syrupaside until it 
                cools well</li>    
            </ol>
        
            <h5>For the dough</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, we add the olive oil, sunflower oil, cognac, 
                orange juice, orange zest, sugar, and mix well with a hand whisk</li>
                <li>We gradually add the liquid mixture to the bowl with the dry 
                ingredients and mix with our hands until the mixture becomes homogeneous.
                We're careful not to overmix and release the oil from the mixture, 
                because the melomakarona won't be as crispy as we want them</li>
                <li>We shape the mixture into oval shaped balls and lay them side by side
                with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>With a fork, we create small holes on the top side of each melomakarona,
                so they bake faster and absorb the syrup more quickly.</li>
                <li>We bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until they turn a deep golden color.</li>
            </ol>
